#### Connecting the world, one blank canvas at a time. Invite others and interact with them via realtime canvasing and messaging and also handwrite your notes on a blank canvas and leverage the Google OCR API to parse your notes into a text file.

Simply run 'npm install' upon cloning. Then run the command 'npm start' to start the server.

Note that in order for the Google OCR API Integration to work, you need to add a file in the main directory called 'gcocr.json' which containes your Google OCR API credentials. Also be sure to add your database connection string in server.js to be able to connect to the database.
